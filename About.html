            <h2 class="animate__animated animate__flipInX">About ARRC</h2>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp">Animal Rescue & Rehab Centre – ARRC in Crestholme, Durban is
                almost 8 years old. Shelley, our remarkable founder started the shelter for the feral cats that she was
                feeding at Albert Luthuli Central Hospital that were getting killed by the feral dogs and by the staff.
                She now has a farm full of rescued cats, some dogs, a pig and rescued chickens. In addition, she feeds
                and medicates feral cats in Durban after work each day.</p>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp">The cats at the shelter have all been rescued as ferals, and
                all have their own sad stories to tell of being abused, burnt with boiling water, oil or acid, poisoned,
                caught in snares, knocked over by motor vehicles, shot, stabbed, savaged by dogs, rescued from storm
                drains, starved or some other hideous history. Each cat is inoculated and sterilised before coming into
                the shelter or after trauma recovery, and kittens are sterilised once they reach the required age.</p>
            <h3 class="animate__animated animate__flipInX">A new beginning</h3>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp">Every cat has a name and each is loved with every fibre of
                Shelley’s being. She is selfless in all she does. The shelter has 2 large 1.5 acres “runs” which have
                lots of trees, bushes, sheds with double beds, wooden kennels with warm bedding & blankets, jungle gyms
                and lots of sheltered areas. There are no “cages” except for the 3 side “runs” which are enclosed at the
                top where newcomers get orientated. Many of the cats are “yard” cats that roam freely around the house
                and 7-acre property.</p>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp">The cats have a very healthy diet, and their daily food
                consists of 8kg raw, cubed pork kidneys, 5kg raw chicken necks, 8kg roasted, deboned chicken, 5kg of
                chicken livers, 1 kg of minced cooked ox lungs, 60 tins of cat food, 80-100 cat sachets for the special
                cases, + 15kg good quality dry food (Hills Optimum care, Royal Canin Ageing, Mom and Baby cat and
                Kitten, and Iams Multicat) per day and tins of Mom and Baby cat Mousse, Hills A/D, K/D and C/D and Royal
                Canin S/O for those with medical conditions.</p>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp">The cats amaze Shelley every day and she learns something
                new from them all the time. There has been an awful lot of heartache along the way, the devastation when
                one passes or a rescue doesn’t end as it should. The life of a feral cat is a hard, miserable one, so
                Shelley’s main aim is to give the rescues the best life she can, and to show them that not all humankind
                is cruel. If one passes, at least I have tried to give them a second chance and they don’t die cold,
                hungry and unloved.</p>
